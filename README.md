## How to use
The front-end of our model is cloud-hosted using Streamlit, which means you can use it without having to compile the webapp yourself (wow!)

#### Compilation of Python model
Our model is contained within `ECS171_Model_Predictions.ipynb`. In order to compile and use the file, you must install the Conda library at https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html
